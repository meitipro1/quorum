"""Measure the test count and the mutation table, and write them into the docs.

Never type a test count into a README. A README claiming a number nobody checked
is the first thing a reviewer catches, and a stale one is worse than none.

    python scripts/measure.py            # report the measured numbers
    python scripts/measure.py --write    # substitute them into README.md

The README carries paired markers and everything between them is generated:

    <!-- measured:mutations --> ... <!-- /measured:mutations -->
